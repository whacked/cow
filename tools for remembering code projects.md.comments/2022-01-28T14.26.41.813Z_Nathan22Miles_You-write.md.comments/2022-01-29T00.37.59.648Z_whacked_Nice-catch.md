Nice catch! You're right, I did *not* address that issue.

I considered adding a section on that, but felt there's already too much text, and it's mostly code (and less relevant to forgetting in general), so I sneaked away from explaining. You're a sharp reader!

I'll add the explanation in a separate article. Thanks for reading!
