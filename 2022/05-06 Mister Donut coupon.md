# the Mister Donut coupon
#storylet #food #funny

Recently, I came into possession of a coupon from Mister Donut. I also came to the realization that I want to have a donut. Could this be a coincidence of fate, or just a marketing trick?

I may never know. But I do know that I can buy 4 and get 1 free with my coupon (plus, I want a donut). So I make my way to Mister Donut.

As I approach the store, a big banner comes into view. Mother's Day campaign: buy 6 get 3 free!

The staff helpfully points out that buy 6 get 3 free is a better deal than buy 4 get 1 free.

Now I have to decide whether I should deny my coupon's right to exist in the name of _4 more donuts for the price of 2_. But 9 is a lot of donut.

	Me: How do you preserve these donuts?
	Staff: Store them at room temperature; they'll be good until tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night! Surely I can't eat that many donuts in one day. That settles it. My coupon will fulfill its duty after all.

So I give her my coupon, pay for 4 donuts, and she boxes them up.

As she hands me the receipt, she also hands me a new coupon. Buy 4 get 2 free.
