Doctors are human, are biological creatures, are statistical pattern recognizers.

And as statistical pattern recognizers, doctors are [Galton machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board). Their brains operates on probabilities and they make prognoses.

A while ago, I started noticing that I had to take frequent urine breaks. But not _just_ frequent: the desire to urinate comes abruptly, so one minute I'm sitting in a chair and the next minute I'm running to the restroom.

The thing about developing these unusually frequent urine breaks is that you don't notice the frequency increasing that much and that badly over time (because you're peeing regularly anyway), and when you finally notice it, it's gotten *really bad*, and you have no recollection of when or how it started.

I was of course quite upset, inconvenienced, and alarmed. Who knows how bad it is, when out of nowhere, I had to pee every 30 minutes! As I was in Taiwan at the time, where medical care is highly accessible, I quickly arranged for a visit to a urologist clinic.

It turned out to be quite a clinic! One the outside, it was a building like any other, but upon passing the entrance, I was greeted with sparkly clean floors, marble surfaces, flat screens in front of every doctor's office, and paintings on the wall -- painted by one of the many highly credentialed doctors in the practice. They spared no expense in showing off their talents, their capabilities, their success.

They must command a wide reputation, because there was an army of patients waiting alongside myself. Since every other chair was blocked by a social distancing sticker, patients without seats would stand or walk about. In time, my number got called, and I went in for my checkup. I described my predicament to the well-built, well-poised young doctor, and he ordered some tests, telling me to return after completing them. I found my way up and down the fancy building to all the facilities, completed my tests, and waited to get called again. At this point, I was the last in line, but was still in amazement from having ordered and completed an ultrasound in under 30 minutes. Another potential benefit of being last in line is putting less time pressure on the doctor -- which hopefully means a more comprehensive evaluation.

I sat down only to learn that all my numbers were normal.

"do you drink a lot of coffee?"

"yes"

Almost as if making a public speech, in his loud and authoritative voice, the doctor declared, "from this day on, you cannot drink even *one drip* of coffee or tea,"

He seemed to place extra emphasis on *one drip*, as if declaring victory over yet another coffee addict!

"what you have is an overactive bladder. You might be wondering, nothing has been wrong with me for all my life, why has this happened all of a sudden? It happens to some people when they age"

Well, I was certainly disappointed, but the last time I went cold turkey it was 5+ cups to zero, and that lasted for months. I thought: if this frees me from the urinal every 30 minutes, I'll play; and if it works, I can probably cheat every now and then?

I left the clinic with some supplementing medication, and the order for a potentially drastic lifestyle change.

Five days passed, no coffee, diligently taking the medication, and I was still rushing to the restroom at a disruptive frequency.

I might have lacked patience for waiting for improvement, but I was also making another evaluation: if the treatment didn't work, every day was another day I had no coffee. What an unsatisfactory trade-off.

With this great displeasure in mind, I decided to get a second opinion at a different facility.

I scheduled an appointment, and arrived at the urologist's office late, because I had trouble locating the entrance. There was no crowd of patients waiting in front of the office to serve as a guide. _There were no patients in line!_ Did I find the most unpopular doctor in the hospital?

The old doctor looked almost twice the age of the young doctor I saw previously. He was very friendly, and very patient. I described my symptoms as I did the previous doctor, also mentioning that I have quit coffee and tried the medication for 5 days with no apparent improvements. Old doctor ordered a different test, one to measure my bladder capacity, and an X-ray.

Oddly enough, the capacity test took me nearly an hour to complete, because I couldn't get myself to pee, even after drinking over 2.5 liters of water.

I returned the next day to discuss the results. Once again, all numbers were normal, and the doctor seemed to be out of theories, until he looked at the X-ray.

"has anyone recommended you to do a stool DNA test?"

"stool?"

"yes, you look awfully backed up there. I'll refer you to the GI"

I visited the GI, and also learned that the stool DNA test checks for colon cancer. That got me _really_ alarmed. But I didn't recall having seen blood in my stool, so maybe this is early detection, also known as "silver lining"?

So I went through the interesting experience of catching my own poo, jabbing a probe into it, and bringing in a funny capsule for analysis. I placed my funny capsule alongside other funny capsules on a rack, wondering if all the other people were as careful to close their capsules with, uh, clean hands. Maybe all the other patients would think this about my capsule. And as these thoughts festered in my mind, even my own capsule seemed to change color before my eyes.

Anyway, I completed the delivery without any incident, the same way as the numbers came back -- nothing unusual.

I was certainly glad to not have colon cancer, but also felt like I was back where I started, still running to the bathroom every hour just to pee for 10 seconds.

But wait. Didn't he say "awfully backed up"?

_I was severely constipated_

Under severe constipation, the intestines put pressure on the bladder, which basically makes it think it's full when it's not. All of a sudden, everything made sense!

Tackling constipation is another issue, but long story short, after I got on regular bowel movements, the problem of frequent urination vanished, just like that.

To recap then, here are some points from this experience:
- when in doubt, get a second opinion, even for something as minor as "needing to pee all the time"
- in my case, i got 2 opinions and _both_ missed the mark, and in different ways
	- the pompous doctor was _completely off_
	- although the friendly doctor also missed, he was helpful, pointed me to helpful diagnoses (like confirming that I don't have colon cancer), and provided vital clues to the puzzle
- personal diagnostics is really a team effort among the patient and the practitioners, and as such, when a patient is highly motivated and cooperative, arrogance is counterproductive
- urology and gastrointestinal systems are intertwined: healthy pee time depends on healthy poo time

But really, _everything is intertwined_. When doctors make a diagnosis, they're watching a marble fall down a Galton Board. Their knowledge, their instincts, and maybe even their high confidence, will push the marble one way or another. There's a chance that they're right -- usually a better chance than you or me -- but it's still a _chance_. At some point, the correct diagnosis might be at the outer sides of the board, and by restricting yourself to few and simple questions, you might only see the marble landing near the center.
